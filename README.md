# Google Instant Index API Script

This project demonstrates how to automate the submission of URLs to Google Instant Index API. It supports both **automatic** (via RSS feeds) and **manual** (via user input) submission methods.

---

## Features

1. Automatically fetches URLs from an RSS feed and submits them to Google's Indexing API.
2. Stores and manages submission history to prevent duplicate submissions.
3. Manual method allows batch URL submission through a user-friendly interface.
4. Supports cron jobs for periodic execution.

---

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Prerequisites

- **Google Index API Setup**:
  - Ensure your website is verified in **Google Search Console**.
  - Create a Google Index API project and download the service account JSON file.
  - Rename the JSON file to `service-account.json`.

### 2. File Structure

```plaintext
project-root/
|--- private/
|    |--- service-account.json
|    |--- new.json
|    |--- history.json
|
|--- collect.php
|--- autoSubmit.php
|--- index.html
|--- submit.php
```

### 3. Automatic Submission (Using RSS Feed)

#### Configure `collect.php`

1. Update the RSS feed URL:

```php
$rssUrl = 'https://yourwebsite.com/rss.xml';
```

2. Place this file in your project root.

#### How It Works

- Collects URLs from the RSS feed.
- Saves the latest 20 unique URLs in `new.json`.

#### Cron Job Setup

Run `collect.php` periodically using a cron job or a service like **cron-job.org**:

```plaintext
0 * * * * /usr/bin/php /path/to/collect.php
```

---

### 4. Auto Index Submission

#### Configure `autoSubmit.php`

1. Place `autoSubmit.php` in your project root.

#### How It Works

- Reads URLs from `new.json`.
- Filters out previously submitted URLs (stored in `history.json`).
- Submits new URLs to the Google Indexing API.
- Updates `history.json` with successful submissions (limits to 60 URLs).

#### Cron Job Setup

Run `autoSubmit.php` periodically using a cron job:

```plaintext
0 * * * * /usr/bin/php /path/to/autoSubmit.php
```

---

### 5. Manual Submission

#### Setup `index.html` and `submit.php`

1. Place both files in your project root.
2. Use the browser to open `index.html`.
3. Enter URLs (one per line) and submit.

---

## Notes

1. Ensure the `private/service-account.json` file is correctly configured.
2. Use tools like **cron-job.org** for periodic execution.
3. Verify the feedâ€™s `isPermaLink` attribute in `collect.php` (default: `true`).

---

## Key Points

- Collects URLs from RSS feeds (`collect.php`).
- Submits new URLs to Google Indexing API (`autoSubmit.php`).
- Manual submissions through a user interface (`index.html` + `submit.php`).

---
### Use Cases:  
- Automate content indexing for blogs or news sites using RSS feeds.  
- Improve website SEO by instantly notifying Google about new or updated URLs.  
- Manage URL submissions efficiently through a secure and scalable system.  

This project is ideal for developers looking to streamline their Google indexing workflow using a combination of automated and manual methods.
